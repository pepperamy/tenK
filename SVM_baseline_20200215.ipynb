looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties . actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward - looking statements . factors that may cause such a difference include , but are not limited to , those discussed in \" item dd : business -- factors affecting the company \\'s business , operating results and financial condition . \" j.d . edwards develops , markets and supports highly functional enterprise resource planning ( \" erp \" ) software for managing the supply chain . the company provides the core software products to run an entire business . these software solutions operate on multiple computing platforms and are designed to deliver the solutions that organizations need to maintain control of their businesses as circumstances , technologies and market environments change . the company released the oneworld version of its application suites in late calendar dd to take advantage of potential opportunities in the windows nt and unix markets , as well as to enhance its position as a leader in the as/400 market . the company \\'s software application suites had historically been designed to operate exclusively on certain mid - range computing platforms , most recently the ibm as/400 platform . the worldsoftware version of application suites for use on the as/400 platform first shipped in dd , and sales of such applications and related services accounted for substantially all of the company \\'s revenue until the most recent dd fiscal years . the company licenses software under non - cancelable license agreements and provides related services , including consulting , implementation , support and training . revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position ( \" sop \" ) dd - dd , \" software revenue recognition . \" consulting , implementation and training services are not essential to the functionality of the company \\'s software products , are separately priced and are available from a number of suppliers . accordingly , revenue from these services is recorded separately from the license fee . license fee revenue is recognized when a non - cancelable license agreement has been signed , the product has been delivered , collection is probable and all significant contractual obligations relating to this license have been satisfied . revenue on all software license transactions in which there are significant outstanding obligations is deferred and recognized once such obligations are fulfilled . typically , the company \\'s software licenses do not include significant post - delivery obligations to be fulfilled by the company and payments are due within a dd - month period from date of delivery . where software license contracts call for payment terms in excess of dd months from date of delivery , revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied . revenue from consulting , implementation and training services is recognized as services are performed . revenue from agreements for supporting and providing periodic upgrades to the licensed software is recorded as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably over the support service period , and includes a portion of the related license fee equal to the fair value of any bundled support services . the company does not require collateral for its receivables and reserves are maintained for potential losses . in october dd , the american institute of certified public accountants ( \" aicpa \" ) issued sop dd - dd , \" software revenue recognition , \" which provides guidance on recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes sop dd - dd . further guidance was published during dd in sop dd - dd , \" software revenue recognition \" and sop dd - dd , \" modification of sop dd - dd , software revenue recognition , with respect to certain transactions . \" additionally , the aicpa issued technical questions and answers on financial accounting and reporting issues related to sop dd - dd in january dd . the company will apply the provisions of sop dd - dd on a prospective basis for new software transactions entered into beginning in the first quarter of fiscal dd . management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations and will not have a significant impact on its current licensing or revenue recognition practices . however , comprehensive interpretations and commonly accepted business practices for these statements have not yet been established . there can be no assurance that additional dd dd guidance and commonly accepted business practices pertaining to the new standards will not result in unexpected modifications to the company \\'s current revenue recognition practices which could materially adversely impact the company \\'s license fee revenue , results of operations and net income . the company distributes its products and services through both direct and indirect sales channels . currently , the company has dd direct sales and consulting offices located throughout the world . the company also utilizes more than dd outside sales and consulting partners with offices throughout the world as an indirect distribution channel to penetrate certain vertical markets or geographic areas . generally , operating margins are higher on domestic revenue than on international revenue . additionally , operating margins are generally higher in the geographic areas where the company \\'s operations are more established than in the geographic areas where the company is investing new resources . international revenue as a percentage of total revenue ranged between dd % and dd % for each of the past dd fiscal years . total revenue from both license fees and services has increased from year to year . as a percentage of total revenue , service revenue is higher than license revenue primarily as a result of the company \\'s historical emphasis on providing consulting and training services that complement its software products and due to increased support revenue from the company \\'s growing installed base of customers . a change in the mix between license fee and service revenue could impact operating income as the gross margins on license fee revenue are generally higher than gross margins on service revenue . the revenue mix may change in future periods depending upon a number of factors , particularly the company \\'s success in penetrating the windows nt and unix markets with the oneworld version of its application suites and in its implementation strategy for oneworld . the company has historically subcontracted a substantial portion of its consulting and training services to third parties . such subcontracted services accounted for dd % , dd % and dd % of this service revenue in fiscal dd , dd and dd , respectively . currently , the company is also pursuing a strategy of relying on third - party implementation providers to contract directly with its customers for oneworld implementations and related services . see \" item dd : business -- third party implementation providers . \" to the extent the company is successful in implementing this strategy and the oneworld version of the company \\'s application suites achieves increased market acceptance in future periods , revenue from subcontracted services and total service revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely decrease . however , there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its strategy or that such products will achieve substantial market acceptance . the company has reassessed , and continues to closely monitor , its international business risks due to the deterioration of global economic conditions in the asian markets , particularly in japan , and in certain other geographic regions . although the company expects that the current worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact its business to some degree , management does not believe such an impact will be material primarily due to the broad geographic diversity of its operations . the company plans to continue to make investments in certain international areas as such opportunities are deemed appropriate and are consistent with the company \\'s overall growth strategies . consistent with its historical results , the company expects that during fiscal dd it will continue to recognize a small percentage of its revenue and operating income from asia and other specific geographic areas that are currently being impacted by adverse economic conditions . the company does not anticipate material changes in its projections of future revenue or operating income as a result of its international operations . however , there can be no assurance that the current economic conditions in asia or other geographic areas will not worsen or that the situation will not have a material negative impact on the company \\'s financial condition or results of operations . the company has experienced , and expects to continue to experience , a high degree of seasonality , with a disproportionately greater amount of its revenue and an even greater proportion of net income for any fiscal year being recognized in its fourth fiscal quarter . for example , in the fourth quarter of dd , the company recognized dd % of total revenue , dd % of license fee revenue , dd % of service revenue and dd % of net income . because the company \\'s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the near term , the company \\'s operating margins have historically been significantly higher in its fourth fiscal quarter than in its other quarters . the company believes that such seasonality is primarily the result of both the efforts of the company \\'s direct sales force to meet or exceed fiscal year - end sales quotas and the tendency of certain customers to finalize sales contracts at or near the company \\'s fiscal year end . because total revenue , operating dd dd margins and net income are greater in the fourth quarter , any shortfall from anticipated revenue , particularly license fee revenue , in the fourth quarter would have a disproportionately large adverse effect on the company \\'s operating results for the fiscal year . the company \\'s first quarter revenue has historically slowed during the holiday season in november and december , and its total revenue , license fee revenue , service revenue and net income in its first fiscal quarter have historically been lower than those in the immediately preceding fourth quarter . for example , total revenue , license fee revenue , service revenue and net income in the first quarter of fiscal dd decreased dd % , dd % , dd % and dd % , respectively , from the fourth quarter of fiscal dd . historically , the sales cycle typically ranged between dd and dd months . during fiscal dd , the company experienced a shortening of the software sales cycle and the company \\'s sales force closed more transactions within a time period toward the shorter end of this range . additionally there is increasing uncertainty in the erp market attributed to a number of factors including global economic conditions , issues surrounding the year dd and strong competitive forces which could reduce the growth in the company \\'s license fee revenue . due to these factors the company is experiencing reduced visibility of future revenue and operating results . as a result , there can be no assurance that the company \\'s future license fee revenue and operating results will not be adversely affected by these factors or that its financial condition , results of operations and market price of the company \\'s common stock will not be adversely impacted . ( see \" item dd : business -- factors affecting the company \\'s business , operating results and financial condition -- lengthy sales cycle and -- competition . \" ) the following table sets forth , for the periods indicated , certain items from the company \\'s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue ( except for gross margin data ) : fiscal years ended october dd , dd and dd total revenue . total revenue increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing an increase of dd % . the company has achieved a greater acceptance of its software products by mid - sized organizations in key domestic and international markets . additionally , new releases of the company \\'s application suites , and enhanced services , support and custom programming capabilities have further increased such acceptance . the total revenue increase in fiscal dd was due to growth in both software license transactions and services , with higher growth in license fees than services . the revenue mix between license fees and services was dd % and dd % , respectively , compared to dd % and dd % , respectively , for fiscal dd . the company is pursuing a strategy to change its revenue mix by achieving greater license fee growth compared to services . the company increased the number of large license transactions and the number of new customers as compared to fiscal dd , expanding its installed base of customers by dd % compared to the end of last fiscal year to approximately dd at october dd , dd . additionally , the company is continuing with a strategy of relying on third parties to contract directly with the company \\'s customers for oneworld implementations and related services which may affect the revenue mix in future periods . however , there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing this strategy or that oneworld will achieve substantial market acceptance . geographically , the overall growth was led by strong performance in europe , the middle east and africa ( emea ) , with a dd % increase in total revenue during fiscal dd compared to last year . the geographic areas defined as united states , emea and the rest of the world accounted for dd % , dd % and dd % of total revenue , respectively , for fiscal dd . comparatively , during fiscal dd , the united states , emea and the rest of the world accounted for dd % , dd % and dd % of total revenue , respectively . license fees . license fee revenue increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing an increase of dd % . the growth was primarily due to increases in the volume of license transactions , the number of new customers added during the year , and the number of large license transactions . the oneworld version of application suites expanded the company \\'s target market to include customers using windows nt and unix platforms in addition to those using the as/400 platform . the portion of license fee revenue generated from customers using either windows nt or unix platforms increased to dd % in fiscal dd from dd % in fiscal dd . the company expects that an increasing portion of the company \\'s future license fee revenue will be generated from customers using windows nt or unix platforms compared to the previous fiscal years . during fiscal dd , the company expanded several sales channel opportunities in an effort to increase license revenue generated through indirect sales channels in future periods . in addition to other international relationships , the company \\'s genesis distribution channel , which is focused on companies with annual revenue of less than $ dd dd , expanded to also include international partners . a new distribution channel , the small business solution , was established to focus on companies with annual revenue of less than $ dd dd . also , the company began partnering with other established software development vendors in key niche markets to focus on expansion outside the traditional erp market . services . service revenue increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing an increase of dd % . the company continued to experience increased demand for services in fiscal dd compared to last year . the increase in total service revenue was led by higher revenue from consulting , the largest component of services , although training and support revenue also increased . consulting revenue increased primarily due to the increase in license transactions and the demand for implementations as well as the expanded capacity from both internal personnel and business partner resources . support revenue increased primarily as a result of the company \\'s growing installed base of customers . training revenue increased primarily due to the increase in license transactions , expanded capacity , additional personnel resources and an increase in prices for certain courses . as a percentage of total revenue , services revenue remained higher than license fee revenue due to the continued increases in demand and the company \\'s ongoing commitment to provide consulting and training services that complement its software products . in any fiscal year , total service revenue is dependent upon license transactions closed during the current and preceding quarters , the growth in the company \\'s installed base of customers , the amount and size of consulting engagements , the number of company and business partner consultants available to staff engagements , the number of customers who have contracted for support and the amount of the related fees , billing rates for consulting services and training courses , and number of customers attending training courses . the company subcontracts a portion of its consulting and training services to third parties . the portion of such service revenue generated through subcontracted work accounted for dd % in fiscal dd compared to dd % in fiscal dd . in addition to subcontracting out some of its service work to business partners , the company put a strategy in place during the previous fiscal year to utilize third parties to contract directly with its customers to implement the oneworld version of its applications suites . during fiscal dd , new business alliances were established to achieve this objective , and several existing alliance partners provided significantly more resources to implement oneworld ; however , to date the company has referred only a limited number of its implementations to such third parties . the transition to this referral strategy had a limited impact on the fiscal dd results due to direct service contracts currently in place and established relationships with existing customers . to the extent the company is successful in establishing this strategy , consulting revenue as a percentage of total revenue is likely to gradually decrease as compared to the previous fiscal year . however , there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its strategy or that oneworld will achieve substantial market acceptance . cost of license fees . cost of license fees includes royalties , business partner commissions , amortization of capitalized software development costs , documentation costs and software delivery expenses . cost of license fees increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . the increase in the dollar amount of costs in fiscal dd compared to last fiscal year was primarily due to the volume of license transactions closed through business partners , resulting in higher commissions to the business partners . in future periods , business partner costs may represent a larger percentage of revenue compared to the previous year if the company is successful with its expanded sales channel initiatives and business alliances that would drive an increase in expense . the overall increase in costs compared to fiscal dd were partially offset by the company \\'s renegotiation of certain royalty agreements effective in fiscal dd which lowered royalty expense in the current year compared to last year . amortization of capitalized software development costs was relatively consistent at $ dd dd for fiscal dd compared to $ dd dd for fiscal dd . capitalized software costs primarily relate to the oneworld applications and will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal dd . the gross margin on license fee revenue increased to dd % in fiscal dd from dd % in fiscal dd . gross margin on license fee revenue varies from quarter to quarter depending upon the revenue volume in relation to certain fixed costs such as the amortization of software development costs , the volume of license transactions closed through business partners , internal terms , and the proportion of the company \\'s software products that are subject to royalty payments . the fiscal dd results were positively impacted by the overall increase in license fee revenue volume and lower royalty expense on complementary third - party software products licensed through the company in fiscal dd compared to fiscal dd . cost of services . cost of services includes the personnel and related overhead costs for consulting , implementation , support and training services , together with fees paid to third parties for subcontracted services . cost of services increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . the dollar amount increase was primarily due to additional personnel and subcontracted service costs to support the growth in demand for implementation and consulting services as well as an increase in customer support staff . during fiscal dd , the company invested additional resources for training its personnel and business partners on the oneworld applications and related computer platforms . as a result , the gross margin on service revenue decreased to dd % in fiscal dd from dd % in fiscal dd . generally , the gross margin on support revenue is higher than on consulting and training revenue , and any change in the mix in types of services will affect the gross margin on total service revenue . in particular , the extent to which the company is successful in implementing its strategy of relying on third parties to contract directly with the company \\'s customers for oneworld implementations and related services will affect gross margin on service revenue . sales and marketing . sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and related overhead costs , including commissions , for the sales and marketing activities of the company , together with advertising and promotion costs . sales and marketing expense increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing dd % and dd % of total revenue , respectively . increased license fee revenue impacted sales and marketing expenses during fiscal dd by driving higher sales commission expense as compared to fiscal dd . the increase in the total dollar amount of expense was also the result of additional personnel and increased advertising and promotion costs for the company \\'s expanded publicity activities . the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased dd % at october dd , dd compared to a year ago . sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased primarily as a result of outside costs associated with the company \\'s marketing , promotion , and advertising placement activity in fiscal dd as compared to last year . the company expects to continue recruiting additional direct sales personnel in relation to the company \\'s future sales goals and the windows nt and unix market opportunities with the oneworld version of its application suites . additional personnel may also be required to support the company \\'s marketing and promotion efforts . as a result , future compensation and other related costs are expected to increase . additionally , sales and marketing expenses may continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue in future periods as a result of the company \\'s anticipated growth and potential timing differences between the anticipated revenue growth in relation to the additional expense from the new sales personnel . general and administrative . general and administrative expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for the support and administration functions of the company . general and administrative expense increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing dd % and dd % of total revenue , respectively . the total dollar amount of expense was higher in fiscal dd primarily due to an increase in personnel and subcontracted services to facilitate the growth in the company \\'s operations . general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined primarily as a result of the growth in revenue volume and increased efficiencies within support functions to effectively manage the overall growth in the company \\'s operations . the growth in support personnel was less than planned as of october dd , dd , and general and administrative expenses are likely to increase at a rate more comparable to the overall growth of the company in subsequent periods . as a result , future general and administrative expenses are not expected to continue to decline substantially as a percentage of total revenue in future fiscal years as compared to fiscal dd . research and development . research and development expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for product development , enhancements , upgrades , quality assurance and testing . research and development expense increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . in addition , no software development costs were capitalized in fiscal dd while $ dd dd was capitalized in fiscal dd . total research and development expenditures were higher in fiscal dd primarily due to a dd % increase in personnel , together with increases in related facilities and equipment costs . development resources were primarily devoted to enhancements of both the company \\'s world and oneworld application suites during both fiscal dd and dd . capitalized software development costs in fiscal dd primarily consisted of oneworld development costs which the company ceased capitalizing during the first half of fiscal dd following the release of the version in late calendar dd . as a percentage of total revenue , research and development expenditures , including capitalized software development costs in fiscal dd , were relatively consistent at dd % in fiscal dd and dd % in fiscal dd . the company anticipates that research and development expense will increase in subsequent periods . other income ( expense ) . other income ( expense ) includes interest income on cash , cash equivalents and investments , interest expense on the company \\'s financing arrangements and its bank line of credit , foreign currency gains and losses , and other non - operating income and expenses . interest income increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd primarily due to interest earned on the investment of proceeds from the company \\'s initial public offering completed in september dd . foreign currency losses increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s . dollar against certain foreign currencies . during late fiscal dd , the company broadened its foreign exchange hedging activities to help offset the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies . such hedging activities can not completely protect the company from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which the company conducts business , the volatility of currency rates , and the constantly changing currency exposures . foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its operations as dd dd compared to the u.s . dollar , and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure . the company uses hedging instruments to mitigate certain currency risk of foreign denominated assets and liabilities . the primary hedging instruments are forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of generally dd months or less in term , and all contracts are entered into with major financial institutions . gains and losses on these contracts are recognized as other income or expense in the current period , consistent with the period in which the gain or loss of the underlying transaction is recognized . all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows . fiscal years ended october dd , dd and dd total revenue . total revenue increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing an increase of dd % . this increase was primarily a result of greater acceptance of the company \\'s software products by mid - sized organizations in key domestic and international markets , together with new releases of the company \\'s application suites , and enhanced services , support and custom programming capabilities . international revenue as a percentage of total revenue was dd % of total revenue in fiscal dd and dd % in fiscal dd . license fees . license fee revenue increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing an increase of dd % . the increase was primarily due to a greater volume of license transactions and an increase in average transaction size . during fiscal dd , all license fee revenue was generated from customers operating on the as/400 platform . the company began generating some of its license fee revenue from customers operating on unix and nt platforms during fiscal dd ; however , the substantial majority of all license fee revenue was still generated from customers operating on the as/400 platform . services . service revenue increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing an increase of dd % . this increase was primarily due to higher revenue from consulting , which is the largest component of services , although support and training revenue also increased . total service revenue is dependent upon the amount and size of consulting engagements , the number of company and business partner consultants available to staff engagements , the number of customers who have contracted for support and the amount of the related fees , billing rates for consulting services and training courses , and average training course sizes . service revenue as a percentage of total revenue was dd % for fiscal dd compared to dd % for fiscal dd . the consistent demand for services resulted from the company \\'s emphasis on providing consulting and training services that complement its software products and the growth in its installed base of customers . cost of license fees . cost of license fees increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . gross margin on license fee revenue increased to dd % for fiscal dd from dd % for fiscal dd , primarily as a result of lower royalty expense on complementary third - party software products licensed through the company in fiscal dd compared to fiscal dd . amortization of capitalized software development costs increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd compared to $ dd dd for fiscal dd . this increase was the result of the amortization of capitalized oneworld development costs , which began upon the release of the oneworld version of the company \\'s application suites in late calendar dd . gross margin on license fee revenue varies , in part , depending upon the proportion of the company \\'s software products that are subject to royalty payments . the company offers certain complementary software products that are subject to royalties payable by the company to third parties . license fees subject to royalties were lower during fiscal dd compared to fiscal dd primarily due to declining license fee revenue from application suites incorporating worldvision , a graphical user interface for worldsoftware that utilizes technology licensed from third parties , as more of the company \\'s customers seeking such functionality during the later part of fiscal dd chose to purchase oneworld . also affecting license fee margins in fiscal dd was an increase in business partner commissions from fiscal dd due primarily to an increase in license fee revenue from the company \\'s genesis version of its application suites , which is offered exclusively through business partners . cost of services . cost of services increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . this increase was due to increased personnel and subcontracted services to support the growing demand for implementation and consulting services . gross margin on service revenue increased to dd % in fiscal dd from dd % in fiscal dd primarily due to lower compensation costs as a percentage of the related revenue . sales and marketing . sales and marketing expense increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing dd % and dd % of total revenue , respectively . the increase was primarily the result of the addition of direct sales personnel necessary to support the company \\'s selling efforts , especially the oneworld version of its application suites . general and administrative . general and administrative expense increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd , representing dd % and dd % of total revenue , respectively . total dollar amount of expense was higher in fiscal dd primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the growth in the company \\'s operations . research and development . research and development expense increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . in addition , capitalized software development costs were $ dd dd for fiscal dd , down from $ dd dd for fiscal dd . total research and development expenditures , including the capitalized software development costs , were higher in fiscal dd primarily due to a dd % increase in personnel , together with increases in related facilities and equipment costs . during each period , development resources were devoted to continued enhancements of the company \\'s application suites . capitalized software development costs for both periods primarily consisted of oneworld development costs . due to the release of the oneworld version in late calendar dd , the company ceased capitalizing oneworld development costs during the first half of fiscal dd . as a percentage of total revenue , research and development expenditures , including capitalized software development costs , were relatively consistent at dd % in fiscal dd and dd % in fiscal dd . other income ( expense ) . interest income increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd for fiscal dd primarily due to interest earned on the investment of proceeds from the company \\'s initial public offering completed in september dd . interest expense decreased to $ dd for fiscal dd from $ dd for fiscal dd due to lower average borrowings outstanding on the company \\'s line of credit during fiscal dd . foreign currency losses increased to $ dd dd for fiscal dd from $ dd dd for fiscal dd primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s . dollar against most european currencies . quarterly results of operations / supplementary financial information the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of income data , both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue ( except for gross margin data ) , for each of the company \\'s last dd quarters . this data has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements and , in the opinion of the company , include all adjustments ( consisting only of normal recurring adjustments ) necessary for a fair presentation of such information . these unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form dd . the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period . in the last dd quarters , expenses and operating income as a percentage of total revenue have varied primarily due to seasonality , which has resulted in disproportionately higher license fee revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter . expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased in the fourth quarter due to seasonally higher license fee revenue . gross margin on license fee revenue has varied quarterly from dd % to dd % within the last dd quarters due to fluctuations in license volume and the mix of fixed and variable costs of licenses . gross margin on service revenue has declined moderately primarily due to the investment in resources for training personnel and business partners on oneworld applications and has decreased in the first quarters of fiscal dd and fiscal dd due to lower service revenue during the holiday season in november and december . based on all of the foregoing , the company believes that future revenue , expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter . as a result , quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance . furthermore , the company believes it is likely that in some future quarter the company \\'s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors . in such event , or in the event that adverse conditions prevail , or are perceived to prevail , with respect to the company \\'s business or generally , the market price of the company \\'s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected . liquidity and capital resources as of october dd , dd , the company \\'s principal sources of liquidity consisted of $ dd dd of cash and cash equivalents , $ dd dd of short - term and long - term investments and a $ dd dd , unsecured , revolving line of credit which can be utilized for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes . as of october dd , dd , the company had working capital of $ dd dd and no amounts were outstanding under the company \\'s bank line of credit . short - term deferred revenue and customer deposits totaling $ dd dd are included in determining this amount . the short - term deferred revenue primarily represents annual support payments billed to customers that is recognized ratably as revenue over the support service period . without the short - term deferred revenue and customer deposits , working capital would have been $ dd dd , and including short - term and long - term investments working capital would have been $ dd dd . the company calculates accounts receivable days sales outstanding ( dso ) by dividing its accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the sum of revenue for the quarter plus the net change in unearned revenue divided by dd days . the net change in unearned revenue is included in the calculation to better reflect sales activity timing rather than revenue recognition timing . calculated as such , dso was dd days as of october dd , dd compared to dd days as of the previous fiscal year end . the company \\'s dso can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors , including the concentration of transactions that occur toward the end of each quarter and the variability of quarterly operating results . see \" factors affecting the company \\'s business , operating results and financial condition -- quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations . \" the company generated operating cash flow of $ dd dd for fiscal dd and $ dd dd and $ dd dd for fiscal dd and dd , respectively . the increases in operating cash flow from year to year were due primarily to increased net income . during these periods , growth in operating assets such as accounts receivable has been funded by similar growth in operating liabilities , primarily deferred revenue and accrued liabilities . tax deductions associated with stock option exercises during fiscal dd increased the deferred income tax asset and additional paid - in capital in the balance sheet as of october dd , dd . the company utilized cash for investing activities of $ dd dd , $ dd dd and $ dd dd for fiscal dd , dd and dd , respectively . the increased net levels in fiscal dd and dd were due to the investment of cash from the initial public offering . during each of these fiscal years , the company purchased furniture , fixtures and equipment that were necessary to support its expanding operations . in fiscal dd and dd , the company \\'s cash utilized for investing activities was offset in part by $ dd dd and $ dd dd , respectively , of proceeds from the sale of assets . in fiscal dd , the company invested $ dd dd to purchase land in denver , colorado , a portion of which is being used by the company for a headquarters facility . financing activities provided $ dd dd in cash from exercises of common stock options and the employee stock purchase plan activity . the company issued a total of dd dd shares of common stock dd dd during fiscal dd . in september dd , the company completed its initial public offering of dd dd shares of common stock , of which dd dd were issued by the company , generating net proceeds of $ dd dd . additionally , during fiscal dd , the company issued dd shares of common stock upon the exercise of options and received $ dd dd in proceeds . the company did not have other significant net financing activities for fiscal dd , dd , or dd . the company utilized its bank line of credit for working capital and other general corporate purposes during fiscal dd and dd but repaid all amounts borrowed within each of these periods . management believes its cash and cash equivalents balance , short - term and long - term investments , amounts available under existing credit facilities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next dd months . additionally , the company may also use a portion of its short and long - term investments to acquire businesses , products or technologies that are complementary to those of the company or to acquire treasury stock . there can be no assurance , however , that the company will not require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes , in which case the company may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources . there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that , if available , such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to the company and would not result in additional dilution to the company \\'s stockholders . the year dd issue is a result of computer systems and other electronic equipment using processors or embedded chips which use only dd digit entries in the date code field and may not be able to distinguish whether \" dd \" means dd or dd . the potential for system errors and failures involves all aspects of the company \\'s operations , including computer systems , voice and data networks and the infrastructure of its facilities . to address the company - wide internal year dd readiness activities , the company established a corporate readiness program during fiscal dd to coordinate efforts already underway in the information technology ( \" it \" ) and software development departments and to expand the program to include all business functions and geographic areas . the program is addressing internal operational and financial risks as well as those associated with business partners and other third - parties . status reports on this program are presented to the company \\'s senior management and to the audit committee of the board of directors periodically . state of readiness . the company \\'s business operations are significantly dependent upon the proprietary software products it licenses to customers . management believes it has already successfully addressed the year dd issues in the current versions of its proprietary software products and does not anticipate any business interruptions associated with these applications . certain custom software applications used internally are not yet year dd ready , and the company plans to finish the programming of needed revisions , testing and implementation by its fourth quarter in fiscal dd . an internal upgrade to product versions of third - party software that are year dd ready is also expected to be completed by its fourth quarter in fiscal dd . the company is working with all service providers to protect its operations from the potential effects of a third - party failing to become year dd ready , and the company has been encouraging its customers to migrate to current product versions that are year dd ready . the following dd - step process is being followed to assess the company \\'s internal state of readiness and to direct preparations for the year dd : 1 ) awareness -- make all levels of the organization aware of year dd issues . 2 ) inventory -- obtain complete detailed lists of specific issues from representatives in every area of the company \\'s business . 3 ) assessment -- complete a detailed inventory review to determine and prioritize areas of exposure ; identify mission critical processes and systems ; initiate certification of year dd compliance for vendors / suppliers / landlords ; establish contingency plans . 4 ) resolution -- decide which systems to replace , retrofit or retire ; initiate conversion to systems that are year dd ready . 5 ) testing -- obtain assurance that conversions were completed properly and that the systems and processes will function correctly ; implement contingency plans . 6 ) deployment -- implement modified systems and processes back into normal production ; monitor contingency plans . overall , the company had accomplished a dd % completion of its readiness process to date , excluding any issues related to the current versions of its proprietary software products which management believes to be generally year dd compliant . the company had finished the first dd steps of the process and had completed dd % of the \" resolution \" phase in its readiness of it systems . in relation to its state of readiness for non - it areas and issues related to third parties with which the company has a material relationship , the company had completed the \" awareness \" and \" inventory \" phases and was dd % complete with the \" assessment \" phase . management expects to be substantially year dd ready company - wide no later than december dd . costs . the company estimates the direct costs to remediate year dd issues will total $ dd dd and does not anticipate such costs will have a material impact on its results of operations . such costs include the budget for the company \\'s corporate readiness programs , it and non - it costs , legal expenses , and expenses associated with a field readiness task force and equipment purchases . such costs do not include an estimate for labor , overhead or other resources that are associated with the impact of year dd compliance but are not directly involved in the project . to date , the direct costs incurred to remediate year dd issues were less than $ dd . risks . failure to correct mission critical year dd problems could cause a serious interruption in business operations and could have a material impact on the company \\'s results of operations , liquidity and financial condition . the actions currently being taken are expected to significantly reduce the risks of an adverse impact . however , due to the scope of the company \\'s operations and the extent of year dd risks , it is likely that the company will not be able to eliminate all potential problems before they arise . significant uncertainty exists in the erp software industry concerning the potential effects associated with year dd readiness . management believes that customers and potential customers purchasing patterns may be affected in a number of ways . many companies are expending significant resources to upgrade their systems . these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those the company offers . additionally , it is possible that certain of our customers are purchasing support contracts only to ensure that they are year dd ready and then will cancel such contracts . many potential customers may defer purchasing year dd ready products as long as possible , accelerate purchasing such products , switch to other systems or suppliers , or purchase the company \\'s products only as an interim solution . although the company currently offers software products that are designed and have been tested to be ready for the year dd , there can be no assurance that the company \\'s software products contain all necessary date code changes . furthermore , it has been widely reported that a significant amount of litigation surrounding business interruptions will arise out of year dd issues . it is uncertain whether , or to what extent , the company may be affected by such litigation . the company mailed information regarding the year dd issue along with a questionnaire to its customers in march dd to assist them in preparations for the century change as well as to help the company assess its customer service demands . based upon the number of responses received and the number of customers that originally licensed recent product versions , the company estimated that over dd % of its customer base is currently operating with a version of its software applications that is year dd ready . however , the company could be faced with an inability to meet the demand for services to upgrade its existing installed base of customers or to meet increased demand from potential customers who still need to address their year dd issues . factors outside the company \\'s control could also cause significant disruptions of business activities and affect the company \\'s ability to be ready for the year dd such as the failure of its third - party business partners , suppliers , government entities , customers , and others to adequately prepare . additionally , third - party software and computer technology used internally may materially impact the company if not year dd compliant . the company \\'s operations may be at risk and a material adverse impact to the company \\'s results of operations , liquidity and financial condition could result if any third - parties fail to adequately address the problem or if software conversions result in system incompatibilities with these third - parties . contingency plans . as part of the dd - step process outlined above , specific contingency plans are being developed in connection with the assessment and resolution to the mission critical risks identified . such planning is complicated by the risk of multiple year dd problems and the fact that many of the company \\'s risks reside with third parties who may not successfully address their own risks . however , the company has currently established certain contingency plans for both it and non - it systems , and it is continuing to develop such plans regarding all its specific mission critical functions . such plans include backup power generators for the company \\'s facilities , explicit manual \" workaround \" procedures and the identification of key contacts worldwide who will be responsible for addressing specific issues and implementing such plans . in january dd , a new currency called the ecu or the \" euro \" was introduced in certain economic and monetary union ( \" emu \" ) countries . during dd , all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency . during the next dd years , business in emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro . as a result , companies operating in or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies , including the euro . although the company currently offers software products that are designed to be euro currency enabled and management believes it will be able to accommodate any required euro currency changes , there can be no assurance that the software will contain all the necessary changes or meet all of the euro currency requirements . if the company \\'s software does not meet all the euro currency requirements of our business , operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected . the company has not had and does not expect a material impact on its results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of its transition to the euro as the functional currency for its subsidiaries based in emu countries . recent accounting pronouncements the company will be required to apply recently issued accounting standards in its future consolidated financial statements . statement of financial accounting standards ( \" sfas \" ) no . dd , \" reporting comprehensive income , \" establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income in financial statements . sfas no . dd , \" disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information , \" establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports . sfas no . dd , \" employers \\' disclosures about pensions and other post - retirement benefits , \" revises employers \\' disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans , but does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans . sfas no . dd \" accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities \" will require companies to value derivative financial instruments , including those used for hedging foreign currency exposures , at current market value with the impact of any change in market value being charged against earnings in each period . sop dd - dd , \" software revenue recognition , \" sop dd - dd , \" deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop dd - dd , software revenue recognition , \" and sop dd - dd , \" modification of sop dd - dd , software revenue recognition , with respect to certain transactions \" provide additional guidance regarding software revenue recognition . the company has determined that the adoption of these recently issued standards will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations . sops dd - dd and dd - dd and sfas nos . dd , dd and dd are effective for fiscal dd . sop dd - dd and sfas no . dd will be effective for the company \\'s first quarter of fiscal dd .   in the ordinary course of its operations , the company is exposed to certain market risks , primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates . uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable , such as political , economic , tax , other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of the company \\'s market risks . foreign currency exchange rates . operations outside of the u.s . expose the company to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into u.s . dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies . during fiscal dd , dd % of the company \\'s total revenue was generated from its international operations , and the net assets of the company \\'s foreign subsidiaries totaled dd % of consolidated net assets as of october dd , dd . the company \\'s exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which it conducts business . the company operates outside the u.s . primarily through wholly - owned subsidiaries in europe , africa , asia , canada and latin america . these foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or , more recently , the euro as their functional currency as sales are generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies . the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies . such hedging activities can not completely protect the company from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which the company conducts business , the volatility of currency rates , and the constantly changing currency exposures . foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its operations as compared to the u.s . dollar , and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure . the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its exposures from foreign net asset and forward foreign exchange contracts as of october dd , dd and its exposure from anticipated foreign revenue in fiscal dd to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates . based upon the results of these analyses , a dd % adverse change in foreign currency rates from the dd fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company \\'s results of operations , cash flows or financial condition for the next fiscal year . interest rates . investments , including cash equivalents , consist of u.s . , state and municipal bonds , as well as domestic corporate bonds , with maturities of up to dd months . all investments are classified as held - to - maturity as defined in sfas no . dd \" accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities \" and accordingly are carried at amortized cost . additionally , the company has lease obligations calculated as a return on the lessor \\'s costs of funding based on libor and adjusted from time to time to reflect any changes in the company \\'s leverage ratio . changes in interest rates could impact the company \\'s anticipated interest income and lease obligations or could impact the fair market value of its investments . the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures and its exposure from anticipated investment and borrowing levels for fiscal dd to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates . based upon the results of these analyses , a dd % adverse change in interest rates from the dd fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of investments and would not materially impact the company \\'s results of operations , cash flows or financial condition for the next fiscal year .'"

       "'  the following discussion and analysis of the company \\'s operations ,   financial condition and financial performance , as well as material contained   elsewhere herein , includes statements that are not historical facts .   such   statements are forward - looking statements based on the company \\'s expectations   and as such , are subject to uncertainty and risk .   for additional   information , the following should be read in conjunction with the selected   financial data and the company \\'s consolidated financial statements and notes   to consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere in this report . the following table sets forth the change in amounts and percentage   change between years of certain revenue , expense and operating items . ( dollars in thousands , except tractor data ) the following table sets forth certain industry operating data of the company . operating revenues operating revenues increased $ dd dd , or dd % , from dd to dd   and $ dd dd , or dd % , from dd to dd .   the increase in revenue   between years includes the following by type of freight : increase ( decrease ) in revenue ( millions of dollars ) *   includes intermodal * * reflects $ dd dd impact from sale of special commodities and   parcel management operations . the company continued its strategy during dd and dd of providing   diversified transportation and logistics management services , which utilize   intermodal , professional management expertise and third - party revenue   equipment .   this growth strategy allowed consolidated revenue to increase at   double - digit rates , while the tractor fleet increased only dd % during dd and   dd % during dd .   dry van revenue , which includes intermodal operations ,   increased $ dd dd , or dd % , during dd and $ dd dd , or dd % during dd .   the relatively new service offerings of logistics management and dedicated   contract significantly contributed to revenue growth in dd and dd .   dry   van truck rates , excluding fuel surcharges , decreased approximately dd % during   dd and declined approximately dd % from dd to dd .   intermodal freight   rates declined approximately dd % during dd and decreased approximately dd %   from dd to dd .   these rate decreases negatively impacted revenues and   earnings in dd and dd . operating expenses total operating expenses increased $ dd dd , or dd % from dd to   dd . total operating expenses , including special charges of $ dd dd ,   increased $ dd dd , or dd % in dd .   operating expenses as a percentage   of operating revenues ( operating ratio ) were dd % in dd and dd % in dd .   the operating ratio for dd was dd % excluding special charges .   the   following operating expense categories increased or decreased at percentage   rates significantly different than the rate of revenue increase during the   period indicated : * the dd % increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the growth of logistics and dedicated contract business , which results in additional payments to railroads and third - party companies for transportation service . * fuel and fuel taxes increased dd % , primarily due to significant increases in fuel cost per gallon .   this cost increase was partly offset by fuel surcharge revenue billed to customers . * the $ dd dd , or dd % , reduction in depreciation expense was due , in part , to gains on the sale of the special commodities and parcel management businesses .   gains of $ dd dd before income taxes were recognized on the sale of these businesses and other assets and were offset against depreciation expense .   gains on the sale of revenue equipment were $ dd dd in dd .   lower depreciation expense on certain revenue equipment and on - board tractor communication devices also reduced dd depreciation expense . * significantly higher accident rates during the first half of dd contributed to the dd % increase in insurance and claims costs .   a decision was announced in july dd to limit the speed of over - the - road tractors to dd miles per hour .   accident rates declined during late dd , partly due to lower speeds and additional management focus . * the significant decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower advertising costs . * special charges of   $ dd dd were recorded in dd to reduce the carrying value of idle and under - performing assets .   no special charges were recorded in dd . * the dd % increase in communication and utilities was primarily due to certain rate reductions and dd - time credits recognized in early dd . dd compared to dd --------------------- * revenue increased dd % . * salaries , wages and employee benefits increased dd % .   this increase was   due in part to a driver pay increase implemented in april dd for the company \\'s least experienced drivers . * purchased transportation increased dd % , primarily due to the growth of logistics and dedicated contract business and resulting payments to railroads and third - party transportation companies . * the dd % increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to significant increases in the size of and upgrading the trailing equipment fleet , the addition of on - board tractor communication devices and lower equipment gains in dd .   gains on the disposition of revenue equipment , which are offset against depreciation expense , were $ dd dd in dd and $ dd dd in dd . * while the number of accidents did not increase significantly during dd , a small number of severe accidents which fell within the company \\'s self- insured limits contributed to the significant increase in insurance and claims . * the significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher levels of spending for driver advertising and recruiting and recognition of certain uncollectible accounts receivable amounts . * special charges of $ dd dd were recorded during the fourth quarter   of dd to reduce the carrying value of idle and under - performing assets . * the dd % increase in communications and utilities was primarily due to higher satellite usage charges in dd related to on - board tractor communication devices . * interest expense increased by $ dd dd , primarily related to higher levels of debt associated with the acquisition of new containers and chassis . in september dd , the company announced a historic compensation package   for its approximate dd over - the - road van drivers .   this comprehensive   plan , effective february dd , dd , includes an average dd percent increase in   wages for this group of drivers .   the expected results of this program   include a more stable and experienced work force capable of delivering a high   quality of customer service .   funding of this increased level of expense ,   estimated to approximate $ dd dd per year , is expected to result from   shifting costs out of driver recruiting and training , safety , and from   improved equipment utilization .   both company - owned driver training centers   were closed in october dd , as an initial step to generate a portion of the   planned cost savings .   dd liquidity and capital resources     this discussion of corporate liquidity and capital resources should be   read in conjunction with information presented in the consolidated statements   of cash flows and the consolidated balance sheets . the company generates significant cash from operating activities and has   substantial borrowing capacity to meet its operating , committed and   contemplated cash expenditures . net cash provided by operating activities was   $ dd dd in dd ,   $ dd dd in dd , and $ dd dd in dd . trade accounts payable at   december dd , dd included approximately $ dd dd due to revenue equipment   suppliers for service equipment received in dd , which funds were disbursed   in early dd . a commitment was made in dd to increase levels of capital spending and   convert the majority of the dry van trailing equipment fleet to newly   designed multi - purpose containers and chassis .   with nearly dd of the new   high cube containers in the fleet , the company has taken delivery of all the   units initially ordered . net capital expenditures declined to $ dd dd in dd , from $ dd   dd in dd and $ dd dd in dd .   these exenditures were funded with   proceeds from long - term debt and cash generated from operations . the company is authorized to issue up to $ dd dd in notes under a   commercial paper note program , of which $ dd dd was outstanding at   december dd , dd .   the company filed a prospectus supplement with the   securities and exchange commission in june dd to issue up to $ dd dd   of senior or subordinated medium - term notes , of which $ dd dd of senior   notes were outstanding at december dd , dd .   in addition , the company had   approximately $ dd dd of uncommitted lines of credit , none of which were   outstanding at december dd , dd .   as of december dd , dd , the company had committed to purchase   approximately $ dd dd of revenue and service equipment ( net cost , after   expected proceeds from sale or trade - in allowances of $ dd dd ) . in october dd the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up   to dd dd shares of the company \\'s common stock , from time - to - time in the   open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market   prices . this was in addition to an authorization in october dd to   repurchase up to dd dd shares .   during dd , the company purchased   dd shares at market prices ranging from $ dd per share to $ dd per   share .   during dd , the company repurchased dd shares at market prices   ranging from $ dd per share to $ dd per share .   during dd , the   company repurchased dd shares at market prices ranging from $ dd per   share to $ dd per share .   the company intends to hold these shares in   treasury for general corporate purposes , which may include employee stock   options and restricted stock awards . consolidated balance sheets at december dd , dd and dd                     dd consolidated statements of operations for the years ended   december dd , dd , dd and dd                                            dd consolidated statements of stockholders \\' equity for the years ended   december dd , dd , dd and dd                                            dd consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended   december dd , dd , dd and dd                                            dd notes to consolidated financial statements                                    dd management \\'s report management is responsible for the financial statements and other information contained in its annual report . the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with appropriate , generally accepted accounting principles , and the other information presented is consistent with the financial statements . in preparing these financial statements , it is necessary to make informed judgments and estimates regarding the expected effects of certain events and transactions that are currently being reported . to meet its financial reporting responsibilities , management depends upon systems of internal controls which are intended to provide reasonable assurance , in relationship to reasonable cost , that assets are safeguarded , that transactions are executed in accordance with management \\'s authorization and that the transactions are properly recorded so as to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . management seeks to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of internal accounting control are met by prudent selection of personnel , adoption of appropriate policies , effective communication to personnel and establishment of an effective system of authorization . the board of directors performs an oversight role with respect to management \\'s financial reporting responsibilities . to ensure effective discharge of its responsibilities , the board of directors has established an audit committee . the majority of the committee members are nonemployees of the company and its subsidiaries . the audit committee has met and reviewed accounting issues , financial reporting and audit matters , including those pertaining to the effectiveness of the company \\'s systems of internal control . the consolidated financial statements have been audited by kpmg peat marwick llp . as part of their audit of the company \\'s consolidated financial statements , our independent accountants considered the company \\'s system of internal control structure to the extent they deemed necessary to determine the nature , timing and extent of their audit tests . these auditing procedures are intended to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in all material respects . kirk thompson                               jerry w. walton president and chief executive officer       executive vice president , finance and chief financial officer independent auditors \\' report we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of j.b . hunt transport services , inc . and subsidiaries as of december dd , dd and dd , and the related consolidated statements of operations ,   stockholders \\' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the dd -
